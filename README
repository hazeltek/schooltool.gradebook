Testing
-------

There are two sets of automated tests: unit tests and functional tests.
Unit tests (sometimes also called programmer tests) test individual components
of the system.  Functional tests (also called customer or acceptance tests)
test only externaly visible behavior of the whole system.

Tests themselves are scattered through the whole source tree.  Subdirectories
named 'tests' contain unit tests, while subdirectories named 'ftests' contain
functional tests.

To run all unit tests, do

  python2.3 test.py -pv

To run all functional tests, do

  python2.3 test.py -fpv

The test runner has more options and features.  To find out about them, do

  python2.3 test.py -h
