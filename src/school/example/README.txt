======================
Example school add-ons
======================

This package contains the add-on components for an example school.

To make the SchoolTool server use these add-ons, add the following line
to your schooltool.conf file:

  module school.example

If you do not have a schooltool.conf file, copy the schooltool.conf.in file
to schooltool.conf, and edit that.
